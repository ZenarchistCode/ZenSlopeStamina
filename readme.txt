[h1]What Is This?[/h1]

This mod reduces stamina recovery of players when they are running up steep inclines.

I never found it very realistic that the player can sprint continuously up mountains - this mod will make it so once they run out of stamina, it will stop recovering until they get back to flat ground or stop running.

It also will deplete stamina 2x as fast on steep inclines. It only takes affect when running UP hills.

You can modify the recovery and drain rate in the JSON config file which will get automatically generated when you run this mod on your server.

The mod can be run as a server-side only mod.

[h1]Installation Instructions:[/h1]

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod only needs to be run server-side, but will work fine if it is run on the client too in a server modpack etc.

[h1]Repack & Source Code:[/h1]

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just keep in mind my future updates won't be applied so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.com

[h1]Buy Me A Coffee:[/h1]

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
